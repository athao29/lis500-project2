            <h2>Numbers Take Us Only So Far</h2>
            <p><strong>Maxine Williams</strong>, Facebook’s Global Chief Diversity Officer, is a key figure in the push for greater diversity in the tech industry. She is known for her straightforwardness and strategic approach, making her a force in the diversity and inclusion space.</p>

            <p>As one of Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg’s go-to executives, Williams has played a major role in Facebook’s diversity efforts. According to Facebook’s 2017 diversity update:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The number of women working at Facebook globally increased from **33% to 35%**.</li>
                <li>Women in technical roles rose from **17% to 19%**.</li>
                <li>Hispanic representation in the U.S. workforce increased from **4% to 5%**.</li>
                <li>Black representation grew from **2% to 3%**.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Despite these improvements, Williams believes there is still a long way to go. “If you ask me when would I be satisfied, I’d be satisfied when it’s 50% [women at Facebook],” she told Glassdoor. “More, I always want more.”</p>

            <p>Her mission goes beyond just increasing numbers—she wants Facebook’s workforce to truly reflect its over **two billion users worldwide**.</p>
